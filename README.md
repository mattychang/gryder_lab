# gryder

This repository contains protocols, pipelines, and analysis scripts used/modified in the Gryder Lab. Wet-lab protocols are created and stored as Microsoft Excel (XLSX) files with experimental setup, calculations, and outputs; Prism files (PRISM) used for analysis are as necessary. README files for pipelines contain version control and implemented file structure.
