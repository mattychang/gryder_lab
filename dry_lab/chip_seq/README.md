# ChIP-seq

ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is a genome-wide profiling technique that maps the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins or specific histone modifications. This folder contains workflows for processing raw sequencing data, calling peaks, generating occupancy profiles, and performing enrichment analyses to assess changes in chromatin landscapes induced by IHK-44.
