# RNA-seq

RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) is a high-throughput technique that quantifies genome-wide gene expression by sequencing cDNA derived from RNA transcripts. This folder contains workflows for building TPM matrices, exploring expression profiles, and performing pathway enrichment analyses to interpret transcriptional changes induced by IHK-44.
