# Proteomics

Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, including their abundance, modifications, and interactions. In this case, we used CHESS-DIA (Chromatin Enrichment for Selective Sequencing–Data Independent Acquisition). This mass spectrometry–based technique is optimized for chromatin-associated proteins. This directory contains scripts for post–CHESS-DIA data analysis, including normalization, statistical testing, and visualization to identify proteomic changes induced by IHK-44.
