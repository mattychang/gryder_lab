# Proteomics

Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins, including their abundance, modifications, and interactions. CHESS-DIA (Chromatin Enrichment for Selective Sequencing–Data Independent Acquisition) is a mass spectrometry–based workflow optimized for chromatin-associated proteins. This folder contains scripts for post–CHESS-DIA data analysis, including normalization, statistical testing, and visualization to identify proteomic changes induced by IHK-44.
