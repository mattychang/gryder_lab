# Cell Proliferation Assays

Cell proliferation assays measure the rate of cell division over time. They are used to determine how quickly cells are dividing under different conditions, such as after drug treatment or genetic manipulation. We use the IncuCyte live-cell imaging approach for continuous monitoring of proliferation.
